# GitHub README: Travel Package Purchase Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to leverage predictive analytics for "Visit with us," a tourism company seeking to expand its customer base by introducing a new Wellness Tourism Package. Utilizing historical customer data, the project's goal is to predict potential customers' likelihood to purchase this newly introduced package, enhancing targeting strategies and improving marketing efficiency.

## Problem Statement

"Visit with us" has identified the need to better target potential customers for its new Wellness Tourism Package, aiming to improve upon its historical approach where only 18% of customers purchased packages due to random targeting. This project seeks to use available customer data to predict the purchasing behavior for the new package, thereby optimizing marketing efforts.

## Data Insights

The dataset encompasses customer demographics, interaction data, and previous purchase history, including age, occupation, marital status, income, and past interactions with sales pitches. This rich dataset allows for a comprehensive analysis to identify key predictors of package purchase.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preprocessing data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature selection.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Deep dive into the dataset to understand customer behaviors, preferences, and significant predictors influencing package purchases.
3. **Model Development**: Employing ensemble techniques such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Stacking Classifiers to predict purchase likelihood.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Utilizing accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC metrics for model performance assessment. Hyperparameter tuning is conducted through GridSearchCV to optimize model outcomes.

## Implementation

- The project utilizes Python for all analyses, with a focus on `pandas` for data manipulation, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization, and `sklearn` for model building and evaluation.

## Outcomes and Recommendations

The analysis provides actionable insights on customer segments most likely to purchase the new package. Recommendations include targeted marketing strategies based on key demographic and behavioral predictors. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble modeling techniques in improving prediction accuracy.

## Conclusion

This project exemplifies the application of data science in enhancing marketing strategies for tourism products. By predicting potential customers' purchasing behavior, "Visit with us" can more effectively target its marketing efforts, ultimately leading to increased sales and customer base expansion.
